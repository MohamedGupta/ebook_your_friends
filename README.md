# ebook_your_friends

Includes a Python script that uses Twython to read a user's timeline and setup a Twitter bot, a Markov text generator to generate tweets based on a user timeline, and a shell script to setup the bot on Heroku.

# usage

TODO: Make these instructions better. But for now:
1. Clone the repo
2. Edit person_bot.py with the name of the person you want to make a bot out of and the frequency you want the bot to tweet
3. Setup a Twitter account for your bot and go to dev.twitter.com to make an app and grab its API credentials
4. Run setup_heroku.sh (make sure you have a Heroku account)
